## Blockchain-based Voting System
## Overview
This project is a Blockchain-based Voting System designed to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized way of conducting elections. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system ensures that all votes are recorded in a tamper-proof manner, enhancing both trust and integrity in the voting process.

## Features
Blockchain Security: Every vote is securely encrypted and recorded on the blockchain, making it immutable and transparent.
Decentralization: No single entity controls the system, reducing the risk of fraud or tampering.
Anonymous Voting: Votersâ€™ identities are protected, ensuring privacy while still maintaining transparency in vote counting.
Easy Access: Voters can cast their ballots from any location using a secure online portal.
Real-time Results: The system provides instant and verifiable results upon the conclusion of the voting period.
Technologies Used
Blockchain Technology: Provides the core framework for the system's security and transparency.
Smart Contracts: Used to enforce voting rules and automate vote counting without the need for intermediaries.
Python: Backend logic and interaction with the blockchain.
HTML/CSS: Frontend of the voting portal for users.
Solidity: Used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
Project Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
npm
MetaMask browser extension for interacting with Ethereum blockchain
Ganache (or any Ethereum test network)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
``` git clone https://github.com/luispreza28/blockchain-based-voting-system.git ```
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
``` cd blockchain-based-voting-system ```
Install dependencies:

Backend (Python):

bash
Copy code
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
Frontend:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the blockchain (Ganache or other Ethereum testnet):

bash
Copy code
``` ganache-cli ```
Deploy the Smart Contract to the Blockchain:

bash
Copy code
``` truffle migrate --network development ```
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
``` python app.py ```
Access the application by visiting http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

Usage
Voter Registration: Voters will register using their Ethereum address.
Voting Process: Voters can cast their vote for the desired candidate.
Result Viewing: Once voting is complete, the results will be displayed and are verifiable on the blockchain.
Smart Contracts
Voting.sol: Handles the election process including voter registration, vote casting, and vote counting.
Ownership.sol: Manages the ownership of the voting process and ensures that only authorized users can start or stop elections.
Future Enhancements
Integration with a mobile app for easier access.
Support for multiple elections on the same blockchain platform.
Scalability to support large-scale national elections.
